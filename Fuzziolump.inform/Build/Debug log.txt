Problem PM_UnexpectedSemicolon issued from inform7/Chapter 13/Sentences.w, line 631

  >--> The text '"A sprig of holly rests nearby. Si [...] that pushes it gently
    towards you."' (source text, line 34) is followed by a semicolon ';', which
    only makes sense to me inside a rule or phrase (where there's a heading,
    then a colon, then a list of instructions divided by semicolons). Perhaps
    you want a full stop '.' instead?
