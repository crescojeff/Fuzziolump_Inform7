Fuzziolump
An Interactive Fiction by jeff creswell
Release 1 / Serial number 190321 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Chamber of Soiled Vestments
The musty warmth of the laundry room has always appealed to you; it suggests a friendly invitation to the unknown, and there always seems to be another unexplored dark corner.  Plus it&apos;s always warm and the soft tumbling of the dryers is soothing.  You smile contentedly at this thought, imagining that few people bother to appreciate the subtle treasures in a blanket of soft shadow.  A shared laundry like the one in your building is exponentially better, since every traveler through it leaves a little bit of themselves behind, enlivening the story.  If you were the type to rifle throw other people&apos;s skivvies it might be livelier-still, but that&apos;s intrusive. Also gross.  The dryer rumbles to a halt, then buzzes obnoxiously.  The world sure seems to love its noise.


You can see a Table (closed) and a Dryer (closed) here.

    <command xml:space="preserve">take clothes</command>
    <result xml:space="preserve">Ducking down peer to inside, you&apos;re greeted by a pleasant surprise -- your clothes are fully dry for once!  As you pull clothes from the dryer and pile them in your hamper, you note that only a single sock of your favorite pair is present and accounted for. They&apos;re the super-fuzzy wooly kind, and are patterned with kittens playing with balls of yarn on one and puppies chasing sticks on the other.  Looking down at the lonely puppy sock, your heart aches a little.  Poor guy.  Practically climbing halfway into the dryer, you reach and flail about for the errant kitten sock to no avail.

Re-adjusting yourself, you poke your head in to take a closer look, expecting ruefully to see only empty dryer walls. Instead, you see the head, forelegs, and fuzzy whiskers of an otter staring at you with anxiety quaking in its fathomless black eyes.  He&apos;s wearing a darling little tophat, bowtie, and a gold-rimmed monocle adorns one eye.  Before you can react, he boops your nose with a soft paw, his expression apprehensive. After a bizarre moment staring at each other in this manner, reality begins to spin and you fear someone has turned the dryer on with you halfway inside!  You close your eyes, bracing for the inevitable pain as you evaluate the strength of the dryer&apos;s tumble cycle first-hand.  There&apos;s no pain, however, and after only a few dizzying seconds the world stills.

Atrium Glade
Only, it&apos;s a different world than the one you left.  A cool breeze and the unmistakable smell of pine needles coaxes you to open your eyes.

You find yourself in a wintry forest glade. Evergreen foliage, bearing a light sprinkling of snow such that it resembles sugar-dusted sweets, surrounds you.  The otter, which sports a pair of fluffy brown wings the same shade as its sleek tawny fur, flits about your head, appraisingly.  His little tophat tilts gently back and forth in a hypnotizing pattern, in time with the rhythm of his lazy wing beats.

A holly bush rustles thoughtfully in the wind.

Only, it&apos;s a different world than the one you left.  A cool breeze and the unmistakable smell of pine needles coaxes you to open your eyes.

You find yourself in a wintry forest glade. Evergreen foliage, bearing a light sprinkling of snow such that it resembles sugar-dusted sweets, surrounds you.  The otter, which sports a pair of fluffy brown wings the same shade as its sleek tawny fur, flits about your head, appraisingly.  His little tophat tilts gently back and forth in a hypnotizing pattern, in time with the rhythm of his lazy wing beats.

    <command xml:space="preserve">take clothes</command>
    <result xml:space="preserve">Ducking down peer to inside, you&apos;re greeted by a pleasant surprise -- your clothes are fully dry for once!  As you pull clothes from the dryer and pile them in your hamper, you note that only a single sock of your favorite pair is present and accounted for. They&apos;re the super-fuzzy wooly kind, and are patterned with kittens playing with balls of yarn on one and puppies chasing sticks on the other.  Looking down at the lonely puppy sock, your heart aches a little.  Poor guy.  Practically climbing halfway into the dryer, you reach and flail about for the errant kitten sock to no avail.

Re-adjusting yourself, you poke your head in to take a closer look, expecting ruefully to see only empty dryer walls. Instead, you see the head, forelegs, and fuzzy whiskers of an otter staring at you with anxiety quaking in its fathomless black eyes.  He&apos;s wearing a darling little tophat, bowtie, and a gold-rimmed monocle adorns one eye.  Before you can react, he boops your nose with a soft paw, his expression apprehensive. After a bizarre moment staring at each other in this manner, reality begins to spin and you fear someone has turned the dryer on with you halfway inside!  You close your eyes, bracing for the inevitable pain as you evaluate the strength of the dryer&apos;s tumble cycle first-hand.  There&apos;s no pain, however, and after only a few dizzying seconds the world stills.

Only, it&apos;s a different world than the one you left.  A cool breeze and the unmistakable smell of pine needles coaxes you to open your eyes.

You find yourself in a wintry forest glade. Evergreen foliage, bearing a light sprinkling of snow such that it resembles sugar-dusted sweets, surrounds you.  The otter, which sports a pair of fluffy brown wings the same shade as its sleek tawny fur, flits about your head, appraisingly.  His little tophat tilts gently back and forth in a hypnotizing pattern, in time with the rhythm of his lazy wing beats.

A holly bush rustles thoughtfully in the wind.

    <result xml:space="preserve">The Winged Otter beams at you.  &quot;Hello, there Human!  My name is Nuvi.  I&apos;m sure you&apos;re wondering what just happened -- the short version is that you&apos;ve been transported across time and space to another world.&quot;  He grins whiskeryly and spreads his little paws wide in proud indication.  Or maybe he wants a hug. 

&quot;This is not Earth, but a wondrous land of whimsy and warmth called Fuzziolump!  Your people&apos;s thoughts and feelings and imaginings gave us life, in point of fact, a process which has accelerated exponentially in recent decades with the advent of telecommunications and a magical thing called The Internet -- all that cognition flying about in the aether sort of landed here, and took root.  It&apos;s not a well-understood matter, but we know we have humanity to thank for our existence! 

Glossing right over that massive tidbit, we&apos;re standing in a lovely little area of the Frosted Forest we lumpkins call the Atrium Glade.  It&apos;s the lumpside connection point, which we call a Socket, of the Conduit you passed through to get here; your dryer was the Socket on your end.  Dryers are often Sockets on Earth for some reason -- we get all kinds of socks and, erm, other underthings coming through.&quot;  He manages to blush through his fur.


&quot;I know that doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense: it&apos;s fine, don&apos;t worry about it.  You can always ask me about Conduits, Sockets, Atrium Glade, Frosted Forest, or Fuzziolump itself on the way, if you like.&quot;  He smiles and blinks placidly while the two of you stare at each other in awkward silence for several seconds.  Then a realization strikes him: &quot;Oh!  Yes, sorry, I haven&apos;t told you why I brought you here yet.  Our Great Need.&quot;  He twitches his whiskers and adjusts his bowtie anxiously. &quot;You see, Fuzziolump has long been a place of peace enjoyed by one and all, but recently there has been an upwelling of violence and turmoil.  The cause is our gods.  We didn&apos;t have any at first.  The fully mortal lumpkins are quite complex enough, and even with the vast sum of Earth&apos;s imaginings it took ages for us to develop.  Several centuries have passed since we grew smart enough to start recording our history, and it seems the more we wrote and thought and felt the experiences of life, the faster Fuzziolump grew.  Its own denizens&quot; imaginings fuel it in addition to Earth&apos;s ever-deepening pool of creative energy, and this exponentiation plus some experimentation with tool-assisted metamorphosis has led to a few more potent lifeforms.  Effectively, gods. 

Now, this might be cause for celebration -- a whole new category of sapient life, more deeply sapient than any of us can fathom!  Unfortunately, power and depth of mind do not equate to wisdom.  The young gods of Fuzziolump are very different, but their common trait is an understandable lack of experience combined with an unprecedented ability to influence the world around them.  Some have even learned to syphon off the creative energy Fuzziolump thrives on, and threaten to collapse this world in on itself.  It isn&apos;t clear what would happen to the gods if this world perished, but I and my loved ones and millions more like us would surely be snuffed out like the humble little candle flames we are.  I cannot allow that to happen.  What to do though?  Every lumpkin knows that Earth and humanity are our progenitors, specifically your creativity.  So, it only seemed reasonable to bring a human creative here to help untangle this little knot of divinity.  At least, I think that&apos;s why we&apos;ve summoned you.  The Council of Animals made it a top secret matter, so little folk like me can only guess.  But yeah, you create every day -- you must know how to turn that power off, or keep it under control?&quot;

A holly bush rustles thoughtfully in the wind.

A winged otter flaps serenely nearby.  His tophat is dapper.

    <result xml:space="preserve">The Winged Otter beams at you.  &quot;Hello, there Human!  My name is Nuvi.  I&apos;m sure you&apos;re wondering what just happened -- the short version is that you&apos;ve been transported across time and space to another world.&quot;  He grins whiskeryly and spreads his little paws wide in proud indication.  Or maybe he wants a hug. &quot;

This is not Earth, but a wondrous land of whimsy and warmth called Fuzziolump!  Your people&apos;s thoughts and feelings and imaginings gave us life, in point of fact, a process which has accelerated exponentially in recent decades with the advent of telecommunications and a magical thing called The Internet -- all that cognition flying about in the aether sort of landed here, and took root.  It&apos;s not a well-understood matter, but we know we have humanity to thank for our existence! 

Glossing right over that massive tidbit, we&apos;re standing in a lovely little area of the Frosted Forest we lumpkins call the Atrium Glade.  It&apos;s the lumpside connection point, which we call a Socket, of the Conduit you passed through to get here; your dryer was the Socket on your end.  Dryers are often Sockets on Earth for some reason -- we get all kinds of socks and, erm, other underthings coming through.&quot;  He manages to blush through his fur.
&quot;I know that doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense: it&apos;s fine, don&apos;t worry about it.  You can always ask me about Conduits, Sockets, Atrium Glade, Frosted Forest, or Fuzziolump itself on the way, if you like.&quot;  He smiles and blinks placidly while the two of you stare at each other in awkward silence for several seconds.  Then a realization strikes him: &quot;Oh!  Yes, sorry, I haven&apos;t told you why I brought you here yet.  Our Great Need.&quot;  He twitches his whiskers and adjusts his bowtie anxiously. &quot;You see, Fuzziolump has long been a place of peace enjoyed by one and all, but recently there has been an upwelling of violence and turmoil.  The cause is our gods.  We didn&apos;t have any at first.  The fully mortal lumpkins are quite complex enough, and even with the vast sum of Earth&apos;s imaginings it took ages for us to develop.  Several centuries have passed since we grew smart enough to start recording our history, and it seems the more we wrote and thought and felt the experiences of life, the faster Fuzziolump grew.  Its own denizens&quot; imaginings fuel it in addition to Earth&apos;s ever-deepening pool of creative energy, and this exponentiation plus some experimentation with tool-assisted metamorphosis has led to a few more potent lifeforms.  Effectively, gods.&quot; &quot;

Now, this might be cause for celebration -- a whole new category of sapient life, more deeply sapient than any of us can fathom!  Unfortunately, power and depth of mind do not equate to wisdom.  The young gods of Fuzziolump are very different, but their common trait is an understandable lack of experience combined with an unprecedented ability to influence the world around them.  Some have even learned to syphon off the creative energy Fuzziolump thrives on, and threaten to collapse this world in on itself.  It isn&apos;t clear what would happen to the gods if this world perished, but I and my loved ones and millions more like us would surely be snuffed out like the humble little candle flames we are.  I cannot allow that to happen.  What to do though?  Every lumpkin knows that Earth and humanity are our progenitors, specifically your creativity.  So, it only seemed reasonable to bring a human creative here to help untangle this little knot of divinity.  At least, I think that&apos;s why we&apos;ve summoned you.  The Council of Animals made it a top secret matter, so little folk like me can only guess.  But yeah, you create every day -- you must know how to turn that power off, or keep it under control?&quot;

You stand in the laundry room.  A speck of lint drifts by, placidly.


You can see a Table (closed) and a Dryer (in which is Clothes) here.

    <command xml:space="preserve">take clothes</command>
    <result xml:space="preserve">Ducking down peer to inside, you&apos;re greeted by a pleasant surprise -- your clothes are fully dry for once!  As you pull clothes from the dryer and pile them in your hamper, you note that only a single sock of your favorite pair is present and accounted for. They&apos;re the super-fuzzy wooly kind, and are patterned with kittens playing with balls of yarn on one and puppies chasing sticks on the other.  Looking down at the lonely puppy sock, your heart aches a little.  Poor guy.  Practically climbing halfway into the dryer, you reach and flail about for the errant kitten sock to no avail.

Re-adjusting yourself, you poke your head in to take a closer look, expecting ruefully to see only empty dryer walls. Instead, you see the head, forelegs, and fuzzy whiskers of an otter staring at you with anxiety quaking in its fathomless black eyes.  He&apos;s wearing a darling little tophat, bowtie, and a gold-rimmed monocle adorns one eye.  Before you can react, he boops your nose with a soft paw, his expression apprehensive. After a bizarre moment staring at each other in this manner, reality begins to spin and you fear someone has turned the dryer on with you halfway inside!  You close your eyes, bracing for the inevitable pain as you evaluate the strength of the dryer&apos;s tumble cycle first-hand.  There&apos;s no pain, however, and after only a few dizzying seconds the world stills.

Atrium Glade
Only, it&apos;s a different world than the one you left.  A cool breeze and the unmistakable smell of pine needles coaxes you to open your eyes.

You find yourself in a wintry forest glade. Evergreen foliage, bearing a light sprinkling of snow such that it resembles sugar-dusted sweets, surrounds you.

A holly bush rustles thoughtfully in the wind.

A winged otter flaps serenely nearby.  His tophat is dapper.
