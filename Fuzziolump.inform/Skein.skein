Plus it's always warm and the soft tumbling of the dryers is soothing.  You smile contentedly at this thought, imagining that few people bother to appreciate the subtle treasures in a blanket of soft shadow.  A shared laundry like the one in your building is exponentially better, since every traveler through it leaves a little bit of themselves behind, enlivening the story.  If you were the type to rifle throw other people's skivvies it might be livelier-still, but that's intrusive. Also gross.  The dryer rumbles to a halt, then buzzes obnoxiously.  The world sure seems to love its noise.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;You can see a Table (closed) and a Dryer (closed) here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Ducking down peer to inside, you're greeted by a pleasant surprise -- your clothes are fully dry for once!  As you pull clothes from the dryer and pile them in your hamper, you note that only a single sock of your favorite pair is present and accounted for. They're the super-fuzzy wooly kind, and are patterned with kittens playing with balls of yarn on one and puppies chasing sticks on the other.  Looking down at the lonely puppy sock, your heart aches a little.  Poor guy.  Practically climbing halfway into the dryer, you reach and flail about for the errant kitten sock to no avail.&#x000A;&#x000A;Re-adjusting yourself, you poke your head in to take a closer look, expecting ruefully to see only empty dryer walls. Instead, you see the head, forelegs, and fuzzy whiskers of an otter staring at you with anxiety quaking in its fathomless black eyes.  He's wearing a darling little tophat, bowtie, and a gold-rimmed monocle adorns one eye.  Before you can react, he boops your nose with a soft paw, his expression apprehensive. After a bizarre moment staring at each other in this manner, reality begins to spin and you fear someone has turned the dryer on with you halfway inside!  You close your eyes, bracing for the inevitable pain as you evaluate the strength of the dryer's tumble cycle first-hand.  There's no pain, however, and after only a few dizzying seconds the world stills.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atrium Glade&#x000A;Only, it's a different world than the one you left.  A cool breeze and the unmistakable smell of pine needles coaxes you to open your eyes.&#x000A;&#x000A;You find yourself in a wintry forest glade. Evergreen foliage, bearing a light sprinkling of snow such that it resembles sugar-dusted sweets, surrounds you.  The otter, which sports a pair of fluffy brown wings the same shade as its sleek tawny fur, flits about your head, appraisingly.  His little tophat tilts gently back and forth in a hypnotizing pattern, in time with the rhythm of his lazy wing beats.&#x000A;&#x000A;A holly bush rustles thoughtfully in the wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <command xml:space="preserve">take clothes</command>
    <result xml:space="preserve">Ducking down peer to inside, you're greeted by a pleasant surprise -- your clothes are fully dry for once!  As you pull clothes from the dryer and pile them in your hamper, you note that only a single sock of your favorite pair is present and accounted for. They're the super-fuzzy wooly kind, and are patterned with kittens playing with balls of yarn on one and puppies chasing sticks on the other.  Looking down at the lonely puppy sock, your heart aches a little.  Poor guy.  Practically climbing halfway into the dryer, you reach and flail about for the errant kitten sock to no avail.&#x000A;&#x000A;Re-adjusting yourself, you poke your head in to take a closer look, expecting ruefully to see only empty dryer walls. Instead, you see the head, forelegs, and fuzzy whiskers of an otter staring at you with anxiety quaking in its fathomless black eyes.  He's wearing a darling little tophat, bowtie, and a gold-rimmed monocle adorns one eye.  Before you can react, he boops your nose with a soft paw, his expression apprehensive. After a bizarre moment staring at each other in this manner, reality begins to spin and you fear someone has turned the dryer on with you halfway inside!  You close your eyes, bracing for the inevitable pain as you evaluate the strength of the dryer's tumble cycle first-hand.  There's no pain, however, and after only a few dizzying seconds the world stills.&#x000A;&#x000A;Atrium Glade&#x000A;Only, it's a different world than the one you left.  A cool breeze and the unmistakable smell of pine needles coaxes you to open your eyes.&#x000A;&#x000A;You find yourself in a wintry forest glade. Evergreen foliage, bearing a light sprinkling of snow such that it resembles sugar-dusted sweets, surrounds you.&#x000A;&#x000A;A holly bush rustles thoughtfully in the wind.&#x000A;&#x000A;A winged otter flaps serenely nearby.
